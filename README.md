# Voltage_Follower
 When you need to generate an analog voltage using a PLC or microcontroller, you should note that their output power will be very low. To use these voltages at higher power, you need to employ a voltage follower circuit.  This circuit can increase the current up to 2 amps and also includes a current limiter, allowing it to be used for lower current requirements when needed.
